  "text": "During holidays my brother usually stays in his room and minds his own business, he doesnt like to interact with people and stays at his room watching anime. When school holidays come, my mom gave us chores to do (like throwing trash, cleaning the plates and vacuuming the house) and he wanted to throw the trash but my mom instructed him to vacuum the house to exercise. (he is overweight but not obese). He agured but lost to my mom.\n\nThe next day at 5 am he woke all of us up by vacuuming the house. My mom asked him wth is he doing and he replied that he was vacuuming the house. My mom wasnt impressed and told him to sleep. But at 5.30 am he woke all of us again with the vacuum. He claimed he had slept for 30 minutes and was eager to vacuum the house.\n\nMy mom then gave in and told him to just throw the trash every morning.\n",
